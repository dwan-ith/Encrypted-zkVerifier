# Encrypted-zkVerifier
ZKPs for Acrium's Encrypted Computing

## Overview

Encrypted zkVerifier is a privacy-preserving system that integrates Arcium's encrypted compute layer with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enable verifiable, private computations on Solana. It allows developers to execute sensitive computations off-chain while proving their correctness on-chain without revealing inputs or intermediate results. This addresses key gaps in blockchain privacy, combining Arcium's secure multi-party computation (MPC) or fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) with ZKPs for trustless verification.

The system targets use cases requiring both privacy and compliance, such as private KYC checks, confidential DeFi risk engines, and secure data oracles.

## Problem Solved

Traditional blockchain privacy solutions have limitations:
- Zero-knowledge proofs require public pre-computation or trusted setups, exposing data before proof generation.
- Encrypted compute (MPC/FHE) ensures private execution but lacks public verifiability without additional mechanisms.
- Trusted execution environments introduce trust assumptions.

Encrypted zkVerifier solves this by:
- Using Arcium for private computation.
- Generating ZKPs to prove computation correctness.
- Verifying proofs on Solana without trust assumptions or data exposure.

## Use Cases

1. Private KYC Verifier: Prove compliance with KYC requirements without revealing personal data.
2. Confidential DeFi Risk Engine: Validate portfolio risk thresholds privately.
3. Private Data Oracle: Attest to off-chain data correctness without exposing raw data.
4. Encrypted AI Inference: Run machine learning models on encrypted inputs and prove output validity.
5. Private Audit Layer: Conduct audits for DAOs or institutions while keeping data confidential.
